🧠 Generative AI for Youth Mental Wellness – Research Paper
📌 Abstract

Mental health remains a pressing challenge for young adults in India, where stigma, high costs, and limited accessibility create barriers to seeking help. Amidst academic and social pressures, youth often lack confidential and empathetic outlets for mental wellness support.

This paper presents a Generative AI–powered solution designed to provide confidential, culturally sensitive, and accessible mental health support for Indian youth. Leveraging Google Cloud’s Generative AI, the system functions as an empathetic chatbot that:
✨ Engages in supportive conversations
✨ Offers personalized coping strategies
✨ Provides curated self-help resources
✨ Escalates high-risk cases to helplines & therapy services

By incorporating mood tracking, peer story sharing, and stigma-reduction features, the solution aims to normalize mental health discussions while protecting user privacy.

🏫 Introduction

💡 Mental health challenges among youth in India are rising due to:

🎓 Academic & career pressures

👨‍👩‍👧 Family & social expectations

📱 Digital lifestyle stressors

⚠️ Barriers to seeking professional help:

🚫 Stigma (fear of judgment)

💸 High costs of therapy

🏥 Limited access to trained professionals (esp. rural India)

🚀 Generative AI opens new doors: confidential, accessible, empathetic, and scalable support systems. This project aims to build a culturally sensitive wellness platform for youth.
